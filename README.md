## About

Developed in motion of not being able to find a good looking and not full of Ads public transit timetable app and deciding to build one on my own.

* This project uses AdMob for showing Banner Ads (Currently only Banner ads are implemented) and Twitter API for fetching user feed for News page implementation. These two are optional and can be easily disabled.

- Main data is gotten from a GTFS feed found here [routes](https://saraksti.rigassatiksme.lv/riga/routes.txt) and [stops](https://openmobilitydata-data.s3-us-west-1.amazonaws.com/public/feeds/rigas-satiksme/333/20221105/original/stops.txt).
- In App Purchases to remove ads are also implemented.

While this app is developed for a specific data feed, it can be easily modified and replaced with different GTFS data. A better template is in progress!
